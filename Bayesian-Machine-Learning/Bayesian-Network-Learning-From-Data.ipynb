    "### 4. Inference in Bayesian Models\n",
    "Till now we discussed just about representing Bayesian Networks. Now let's see how we can do inference in a Bayesian Model and use it to predict values over new data points for machine learning tasks. In this section we will consider that we already have our model. We will talk about constructing the models from data in later parts of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In inference we try to answer probability queries over the network given some other variables. So, we might want to know the probable grade of an intelligent student in a difficult class given that he scored good in SAT. So for computing these values from a Joint Distribution we will have to reduce over the given variables that is $I = 1$, $D = 1$, $S = 1$ and then marginalize over the other variables that is $L$ to get $P(G | I=1, D=1, S=1)$.\n",
    "But carrying on marginalize and reduce operation on the complete Joint Distribution is computationaly expensive since we need to iterate over the whole table for each operation and the table is exponential is size to the number of variables. But in Graphical Models we exploit the independencies to break these operations in smaller parts making it much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the very basic methods of inference in Graphical Models is __Variable Elimination__."

    "$\\mathbb{P}(D, I, G, L, S) = P(L|G) * P(S|I) * P(G|D, I) * P(D) * P(I)$\n",

    "Now since not all the conditional distributions depend on all the variables we can push the summations inside:\n",
