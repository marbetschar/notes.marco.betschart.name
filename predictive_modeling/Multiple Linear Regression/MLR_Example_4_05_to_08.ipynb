    "It is estimated that the Asian category will have $ 18.69 $ less debt than the African American category, and that the Caucasian category will have 12.50 less debt than the African American category.

Once again, the level selected as the baseline category is arbitrary, and the final predictions for each group will be the same regardless of this choice. However, the coefficients and their p-values do depend on the choice of dummy variable coding. Rather than rely on the individual coefficients, we can use an F-test to test \n",
